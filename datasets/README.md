I wanted to host a few datasets that can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) to make it easier to run some benchmarks on these. An effort is made to respect the License of each dataset and as a rule we'll only consider datasets of past competitions in this repository.

## Playground Series 

Datasets with the [CC by 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licenses were copied into this project and turned into parquet. Only the `train.csv` files are kept.
